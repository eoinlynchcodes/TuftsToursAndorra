						<blockquote><i>"I have been working with Daire for just over a year. In my opinion, he is one of
								the best
								around. Daire is very down to earth and understanding of one's lifestyle and day to day
								schedule. Daire was constantly there to support me and give me feedback while also
								providing
								me with an education in sports performance and training. Daire helped me loose 24kg over
								6
								months. He turned my life around. Daire is not in for money, he's in it to make a
								difference."</i>

						<blockquote><i>My performance was always average until I started working with Daire. I was
								always the rider
								who would struggled to finish races and this made me question myself over and over
								again. I
								was ready to stop cycling until I met Daire. Daire, a humble, intelligent and extremely
								friendly guy changed my outlook from my initial consultation with him. I have been
								working
								with Daire for over 18 months and haven't looked back since. I have gone from just about
								finishing races to winning my first A4 race, placed a number of times in the A3 category
								and
								I have now been upgraded to A2. Daire set out a clear and objective plan and educated me
								in
								the process, the structure was brilliant and the constant feedback was second to
								none.</i>

						<blockquote><i>"One of the best around. Daire's ability to communicate and describe training in
								a simple
								and
								clear manner made a huge difference for me when I was trying to learn about the training
								process when preparing for my first Ultra Endurance cycling event. I wanted a coach who
								could educate me, provide me with feedback and give me a structured training plan suited
								to
								my needs, Daire delivered on all of these and provided me with a service that was out of
								this world when it comes to the current coaching services on offer with other
								providers." <h4>- Darragh</h4></i>

						<blockquote><i>"Daire's knowledge and experience speaks for itself. The biggest thing that
								improved for me
								when working with Daire was my mental health. I used to suffer a lot from anxiety when I
								self-coached myself as I never seen improvements in the long term. I came across Daire
								on
								Instagram and I was blown away by the content he provided, the way he spoke and the way
								he
								communicated with individuals. I sent Daire a message at the beginning of 2020 asking if
								I
								could come on board for coaching and he humbly accepted. It was the best thing I've ever
								done for my cycling performance, my anxiety relating to my sport has disappeared and my
								overall physical capabilities as an athlete have improved tenfold. If you need a coach
								to
								help you improve your performance and potentially change your life, then Daire is the
								best
								candidate for the job."</i>
