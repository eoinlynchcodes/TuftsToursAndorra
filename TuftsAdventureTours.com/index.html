      <p>Andorra and neighboring France and Spain in the Pyrenees are renowned for many things. For hiking, skiing, it's
        high altitude, it's beautiful mountains. Andorra's hidden gems of gravel roads have largely been kept a
        secret...<br><br>

        The home of many a pro cyclist and athlete, it is a playground for bike riding with endless roads twisting up
        and down, gravel roads across mountains and valleys and everything to test the most technically able mountain
        bikers.<br><br>


        The type of bike ride possible here:
        “If starting from Andorra La vella, make your way up to La Massana. From there climb up to the CG4 direction
        Pal. Take the CG4 all the way to Port de Cabus. From La Vella it’s roughly 1300 m of climbing. At the summit the
        road turns to Gravel and becomes the Carretera de Tor. Big descent passing Tor and Noris and finally coming back
        on pavement in Alins. From there take a left on the L-510 down the valley to the L-504 junction, taking a right
        on L-504 heading north to Tavascan. From Tavascan take the Cami de Graus through Quanca. This is a nice gravel
        road and climbing roughly 700 m until the road ends and then turns to single track/trail. There’s some good
        riding and some hiking until the pass at 2100 m. Now you are in France. Some steep technical hiking downhill and
        some great technical descending sections. The route finally washes out on a small D road in the Ossese valley
        and turns into the D38. Descend until you come to the D8f. Take the D8f until the D18 junction and turn right.
        This takes you to the town of Vicdessos. Follow signs to Auzat. From Auzat take the D8 up the Soulcem valley. A
        massive climb awaits. After Soulcem lake the road turns to gravel and you keep climbing deep into the big
        mountains. As the gravel road comes to an end there is a small trail on the left heading up to the Port de Rat.
        From here about an hour of hike and bike to the 2500m pass. Then the trail drops steeply down into Andorra
        Arcalis ski area. The road is gravel at 1st and then become paved as you get closer to the ski station. Take the
        CS-380 until Ordino and now you descend all the way back to La vella. The route could be done in one very
        massive day but I recommend taking 2 days to really enjoy it.”</p>

      <p> Come join us in the high Garrotxa North of Girona for 6 days of gravel specific training. This will be the 1st
        edition of spring training camps with Tufts adventure Tours. The terrain is wild and difficult each day is
        guaranteed to be epic.<br><br>
        The idea of these camps is to push your boundaries and step out of the comfort zone a bit
        to prepare you for the upcoming season, whether that is on the road or gravel/adventure racing.
        There will be 3 guides and 3 different levels to help everyone achieve their goals.<br><br>

        The camp will be based out of a beautiful old catalan farm house with all the amenities. We will have a Chef,
        soigneurs and mechanic to make sure everyone
        has a great experience and all your needs are taken care of, so you can focus on the big days of
        training.<br><br> We
        are going to have evening chats discussing how to prepare for your events covering topics such as lifestyle,
        nutrition, training load and a number of other protocols. Sit down with Svein Tuft and pick his brain and learn
        some of the tactics that allowed him to thrive in the world tour until the age of 42. Learn from renowned
        adventure racer and head guide David Rovira how to tackle multi day adventure races.<br><br>

        There's a wealth of knowledge in these 2 veterans of endurance sport and our aim is to help you bypass a lot of
        the typical hurdles
        many come across in the early years of taking on big challenges such as dirty Kanza or Trans alps. It will be an
        amazing 6 days learning together in one of the most beautiful places on the planet. We look forward to meeting
        you.<br><br><br></p>

      <p><i>
          "More than 20 years ago I was exploring by bike as a young man in
          Northern Canada, Yukon and Alaska. In a strange turn of events this led
          me to my profession of 20 years in the pro peleton. I was riding gravel
          before it was cool.
          <br><br>
          In those days it was what you had to do to get up
          North. I loved it then but I love it more now. The bikes and technology
          have been a big factor in that. It’s amazing what kind of terrain you
          can travel in one day on a modern gravel bike.
          <br><br>
          <img src="images/SveinoAndDog.jpeg" alt="Bike, Svein, Dog">
          <br><br>
          The thing I love the most
          now, is to see people out in the mountains seeing what I get to see on a
          daily basis. The smiles on their faces after a very difficult,
          beautiful, epic day is what motivates me these days.
          <br> <br>
          I want our guests
          to have an experience of a lifetime and I want them to return the next
          year or next month!"</i><br><br>
